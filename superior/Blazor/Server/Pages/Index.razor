        Formally verified algorithms are computer programs that have been mathematically proven to work correctly according to a rigorous specification. Unlike ordinary software, their correctness is guaranteed, which is crucial for applications where errors could have serious consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
        Elections are one such application. Using formally verified algorithms ensures that your voting process is secure, tamper-proof, and transparent. Voters can trust that their votes are counted correctly and that the results reflect the true outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>University of Regensburg</strong> offers a secure online election service using these formally verified algorithms. Whether for student council elections, club votes, or research purposes, our system allows you to run a reliable election entirely online.
